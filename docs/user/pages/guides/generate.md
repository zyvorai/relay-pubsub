## Purpose

Seed Demo or Farm catalogs into memory so Demo and Tests have topics to use.

## When to use it

- Open **Generate** when the job matches this screen
- Prefer the product home / Get started panel if you are unsure where to begin
- Confirm health and auth tokens if probes fail

## How to get there

- UI path: `/ui/` → **Generate** (or matching nav tab)
- Spotlight / in-app links when available

## Operate from the console (UX)

1. Open the relay-pubsub UI (`/ui/`) on `https://<host>:…` (see Admin basics for the default port).
2. Navigate to **Generate**.
3. Complete the on-screen fields / actions for this surface (Seed Demo or Farm catalogs into memory so Demo and Tests have topics to use.).
4. Use **Probe** / **Save** / **Send** (or the primary button on the page) and watch status chips.
5. **Empty / fail:** Check Admin basics env vars, JWT/`API_TOKEN`, TLS insecure for lab certs, and backend reachability.
6. **Success:** Status shows healthy / accepted; related Lab or Logs surfaces reflect the change.

Never publish lab IPs — use `<host>`.
